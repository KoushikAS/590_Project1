# Project #1: Sorting Algorithms 
ECE 590 – Fall 2023

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of various sorting algorithms. The algorithms implemented include Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. This repository serves as a showcase of the understanding and application of these fundamental algorithms in Python.

### Key Concepts Covered
- Efficient sorting algorithm implementations
- Runtime analysis and comparison
- Code optimization for improved performance

## Algorithms Implemented
1. **Selection Sort:** A simple comparison-based sort with an average and worst-case complexity of O(n²).
2. **Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time with an average complexity of O(n²).
3. **Bubble Sort:** A straightforward sorting algorithm with a complexity of O(n²) in the average and worst-case scenarios.
4. **Merge Sort:** An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm with a worst-case complexity of O(n log n).
5. **Quick Sort:** An efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order.

## Repository Structure
- `project1.py`: Main Python file containing the implementation of all sorting algorithms.
- `project1tests.py`: Test suite for validating the correctness and efficiency of the sorting algorithms.
- `Report.pdf`: Additional documentation and analysis reports.
- `/data`: Sample datasets used for testing and performance analysis.

## Running the Code
To run the sorting algorithms and view their performance:

```bash
python project1.py
```

## Performance Analysis
- Detailed runtime comparisons and log-log runtime analysis included.
- Analysis of algorithmic efficiency on both sorted and unsorted arrays.

## Collaboration
This project was completed as part of a collaborative effort with Shravan MS, adhering to the principles of pair programming.
